*This program will generate R relation disk blocks sort them and join them in one block.

*The provided S disk blocks are for testing purposes and each time you launch the sort/merge
their content will change so a second launch of the program will not give the same result
because the algorithm works on these files and changes them each time it is run.

*Please make a backup copy of the S00-S08 files in the testFiles folder before anything and
each time you want to launch the program erase the contents of the testFiles folder and
put a copy of the backup files you made.
